# Project Auga
##### by RandyKnapp / n4

Project Auga is a completely re-imagined, modder-friendly UI-overhaul for Valheim. Every last piece of UI was considered and reworked from the ground-up to create a more helpful and immersive player experience, all while remaining familiar to Valheim veterans.

## What's Changed?

Basically everything:
  * New Player HUD
  * Redesigned Player & Container inventories
  * New Consolidated Player Panels
  * Improved Crafting Panels
  * Expanded Character Select & New Character Screens
  * Overhauled Loading Screens
  * Auga-Style EVERYTHING
